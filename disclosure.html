        <h1>ZaaWea Game Public Disclosure</h1>
        <p><strong>Creator:</strong> MHD WAILL TATARI</p>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 9/12/2024</p>
        <p><strong>Game Name:</strong> ZaaWea (Z-A-A-W-E-A)</p>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Strategy Board Game</p>
        <p><strong>Players:</strong> 2 Players</p>
        <p><strong>Game Concept:</strong> ZaaWea is a two-player board game with simple, math-based rules that revolve around moving geometric shapes (triangle, square, hexagon, octagon) on an 8x8 board. The shapes have unique movement rules, and the objective is to outsmart the opponent using strategic merging and movement to win the game. The game draws inspiration from classic board games such as chess but introduces new strategic elements with a unique merging mechanic.</p>
